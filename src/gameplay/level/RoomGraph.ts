/*

Represent the level as a set of room nodes with directional connections.

Each node contains a RoomDefinition and a position offset (x, y in grid space).

Prevent overlap by tracking used grid positions.

Hint: Depth-first placement works well if youâ€™re aiming for dungeon-style chains. Use a Set<string> to track used (x,y) grid keys.

Tracks placed rooms in a grid (Map<string, Room>)

Starts with a seedRoom at (0, 0)

Expands in random directions, up to maxRooms

Calls generateRoom for each new placement
